# User-Info-App
Create a Node.js application that is the beginning of a user management system. The users are all saved in a "users.json" file, and you can currently do the following:
- search for users
- add new users to your users file.
- add AJAX request with:
Part 1: Autocomplete
Every time the user enters a key it modifies the form which makes an AJAX call that populates the search results.

Part 2: Bandwidth optimization
Modify the form with AJAX requests which happen at most once every 300 milliseconds.
